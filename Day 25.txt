25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group
 
Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]

Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]

My Solution: 

/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }

class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseKGroup(ListNode head, int k) {

        // Step 1: Check if there are at least k nodes remaining
        ListNode curr = head;
        int count = 0;
        while (curr != null && count < k) {
            curr = curr.next;
            count++;
        }
        if (count < k) return head;  // not enough nodes, leave as is

        // Step 2: Reverse k nodes
        curr = head;
        ListNode prev = null;
        count = 0;
        while (count < k) {
            ListNode nextNode = curr.next;
            curr.next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = nextNode;
            count++;
        }

        // Step 3: Recursively reverse the remaining list and connect
        head.next = reverseKGroup(curr, k);

        // prev is new head after reversing k nodes
        return prev;
    }
