Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [4,5,1,2,3]
Example 2:


Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
Output: [2,0,1]

My Solution:

class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head, k):
        if not head or not head.next or k == 0:
            return head

        # find length and tail
        length = 1
        tail = head
        while tail.next:
            tail = tail.next
            length += 1

        k %= length
        if k == 0:
            return head

        # make it circular
        tail.next = head

        # find new tail
        steps = length - k
        new_tail = head
        for _ in range(steps - 1):
            new_tail = new_tail.next

        new_head = new_tail.next
        new_tail.next = None

        return new_head
