The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1

My Solution:


class Solution:
    def totalNQueens(self, n: int) -> int:
        cols = set()
        diag1 = set()   # r - c
        diag2 = set()   # r + c
        self.count = 0
        
        def backtrack(r):
            if r == n:
                self.count += 1
                return
            for c in range(n):
                if c in cols or (r - c) in diag1 or (r + c) in diag2:
                    continue
                cols.add(c)
                diag1.add(r - c)
                diag2.add(r + c)
                backtrack(r + 1)
                cols.remove(c)
                diag1.remove(r - c)
                diag2.remove(r + c)
        
        backtrack(0)
        return self.count
