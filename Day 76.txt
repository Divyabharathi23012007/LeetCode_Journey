Hint
Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
Example 2:

Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
Example 3:

Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.

My Solution:

class Solution {
    public String minWindow(String s, String t) {
        if (t.length() > s.length()) return "";

        int[] need = new int[128];
        for (char c : t.toCharArray()) need[c]++;

        int required = t.length();
        int left = 0, start = 0, minLen = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
            char c = s.charAt(right);
            if (need[c] > 0) required--;
            need[c]--;

            while (required == 0) {
                if (right - left + 1 < minLen) {
                    minLen = right - left + 1;
                    start = left;
                }
                char lc = s.charAt(left);
                need[lc]++;
                if (need[lc] > 0) required++;
                left++;
            }
        }
        return minLen == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? "" : s.substring(start, start + minLen);
    }
}
