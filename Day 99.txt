You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. Recover the tree without changing its structure.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,3,null,null,2]
Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
Explanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid.
Example 2:


Input: root = [3,1,4,null,null,2]
Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]
Explanation: 2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 < 3. Swapping 2 and 3 makes the BST valid.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 1000].
-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1


class Solution {
    TreeNode first;
    TreeNode second;
    TreeNode prev;

    public void recoverTree(TreeNode root) {
        helper(root);
        // Swap the values of the two misplaced nodes
        int temp = first.val;
        first.val = second.val;
        second.val = temp;
    }

    void helper(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return;

        // Traverse left subtree
        helper(node.left);

        // Detect swapped nodes
        if (prev != null && prev.val > node.val) {
            if (first == null) {
                first = prev;
            }
            second = node;
        }

        prev = node;

        // Traverse right subtree
        helper(node.right);
    }
